A clone of the Darts (Double-ARray Trie System)

This project provides a clone of the Darts (Double-ARray Trie System)
developed by Taku Kudo. The clone library has an advantage in memory.

The Darts is a C++ header library for the double-array that was presented
by Jun-ichi Aoe as an efficient implementation of a trie. In practice,
the Darts is used in several applications such as ChaSen and MeCab
(Japanese morphological analyzers) because the double-array provides fast
prefix matching for multiple patterns with a compact dictionary.

However, the Darts is based on a traditional implementation, and in fact,
we can improve the performance of the Darts by using a new implementation.
Therefore, this project provides a Darts-like library that is based on
a new implementation of the double-array.
